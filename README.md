🧠 AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy
An AI-powered assistant built using IBM Cloud Lite, Watsonx.ai, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to make digital finance accessible and secure for everyone — especially first-time users, students, and rural populations. This assistant answers questions about UPI, online fraud prevention, budgeting, interest rates, and more using reliable sources like government and banking websites.
